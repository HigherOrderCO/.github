# Welcome to [Higher Order Company](http://higherorderco.com/)

We're the HOC, a tech startup with the goal of building the inevitable massively
parallel future of computers. We believe the [Interaction
Net](https://tinyurl.com/interactioncombinators) is a powerful model of
computation that will give birth to massively parallel runtimes and processors.
To pave the way forward, we built:

- [HVM](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/hvm): a parallel runtime

- [Kind](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/kind): a parallel proof language

- [Kindelia](https://github.com/HigherOrderCo/kindelia): a parallel P2P computer
