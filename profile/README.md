# Welcome to [Kindelia](http://kindelia.org/)

We're Kindelia, a community passionate about technology and functional programming. We believe the [Interaction
Net](https://tinyurl.com/interactioncombinators) is the most underrated model of computation, and that it will disrupt
the industry by finally making massive parallelism trivial. To prove our point, we've developed
[HVM](https://github.com/kindelia/hvm), a new runtime based on that model, and it already outperforms JavaScript's V8,
Haskell's GHC, and even C in many cases. Now, we spend our time maintaining HVM, and exploring its applications. Some of our
works include [Kind](https://github.com/kindelia/kind), a new proof language, and
[K-Chan](https://github.com/kindelia/k-chan), a P2P computer. Our main goal is to keep developing software that makes us
happy, and, at the same time, empower developers around the world. Check also our [manifesto](https://github.com/Kindelia/manifesto).
